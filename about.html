        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            The bakery, named "Sweet Dreams," was founded by a young couple, Alice and Bob, who had a passion for baking
            and a dream of starting their own business. Alice and Bob had both grown up in families that loved to bake,
            and they had spent many happy hours in the kitchen learning the secrets of their parents' and grandparents'
            recipes.
        </p>

        <p>
            After they got married, Alice and Bob decided to take their passion for baking to the next level and start
            their own bakery. They spent months researching the best ingredients and testing their recipes, and finally,
            they opened "Sweet Dreams" in a small shop on Main Street.
        </p>

        <p>
            At first, business was slow, but as word of their delicious baked goods spread, more and more customers
            started coming to the bakery. Alice and Bob worked hard to create new and exciting flavors and to keep their
            prices affordable, and before long, "Sweet Dreams" had become a beloved institution in their community.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the years, the bakery grew and expanded, and Alice and Bob passed their passion for baking down to
            their children, who helped them run the business. Today, "Sweet Dreams" is still a family-owned bakery that
            is known for its delicious, fresh-baked treats and its commitment to using only the highest-quality
            ingredients.
